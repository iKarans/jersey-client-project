# Lujam-Jersey Project

This project was created with react and firebase by the Jersey intake of the \_nology software developer course. The project demonstrated possible design changes for Lujams dashboard redesign.

### Overview

The project ran for four weeks, with each week taking the form of a sprint, with a new product owner. We used Trello to manage our tickets, and Github to allow us to work on multiple features, and merge them when they were completed. Each sprint ended with a demo to the clients, and feedback which informed the next weeks tickets. The team wrote the tickets, estimated time for each one, and assigned them at the start of the new sprint.
The application was built from wireframes created by Jake Wood, a coach for the course.
