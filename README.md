# Lujam-Jersey Project

This project was created with react and firebase by the Jersey intake of the \_nology software developer course. The project demonstrated possible design changes for Lujams dashboard [redesign](https://lujam-jersey.web.app/).

## Overview

The project is built in React and uses Firebase for hosting and authorization.

The project ran for four weeks, with each week taking the form of a sprint with a new product owner assigned. Each sprint ended with a demo to the clients. The feedback informed the next sprint's tickets.

The product owner planned the tickets and wrote the acceptance criteria for completion.

Trello was used to manage workflow. A git branching strategy was used to work on multiple features. Once a pull request was completed the feature would be added to the codebase.

The application was built from [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/RV6ZK8nzvqFlTZoG37TwUU/Lujam-Portal-V2?node-id=82%3A5204) created by [Jake Wood](https://github.com/jakealistairwood).
